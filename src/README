# whatever strategy #
I choose to implement 'WhateverPlayer'
such that every turn (iteratively until success) he randomly choose  coordinates in the board
and tries to mark those coordinates.

# clever strategy #
I choose to implement 'CleverPlayer'
such that every turn (iteratively until success) she goes row by row and try to mark cells.
so that most of the times she will win the player that plays randomly.

# snartypamets strategy #

I choose to implement 'SnartyPametsPlayer'
such that every turn (iteratively until success) he know that ms.clever goes row by row.
so he will try to overcome her by going column by column and moreover start from the middle his searching for available cells .
so that most of the times he will win the clever strategy.
